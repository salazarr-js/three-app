# Three App - Multiple Instances

This demo shows how to have multiple `three-app` instances running safely using iframes.

> [!NOTE]
> This is just a temporary workaround.

## ðŸ“Œ Considerations

âœ… This project uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) as package manager <br />
âœ… This is a scaffolded [vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) project using the `vanilla-ts` template <br />
âœ… `src/three-apps` folder is where all the three app related code is located <br />
âœ… [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) is configured via `tsup.config.ts` config file <br />
âœ… The content of the iframes is set via the `srcdoc` attribute <br />
âœ… `getHTMLTemplate()` util function helps to generate the template

## ðŸš€ Scripts

```bash
pnpm run dev   # Start `tsup` in watch mode and `vite` dev server
pnpm run build # Build all the three-apps scripts on `public` folder and generate a production build
```
